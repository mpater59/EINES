    Three OpenFlow commands are sent in sequence: one to measure T1, second to measure T3, and third to
    measure T2 (see the lab instructions). T1 and T2 are used with ststistics requerst/response method
    (other OpenFlow command could be used), while T3 is measured with sending/receiving PACKET_OUT/PACKET_IN by
    the controller. For more on the use of timers for non-blocking tasks in POX see section: "Threads, Tasks, and
    Timers: pox.lib.recoco" in http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/auxiliary_files/mininet/poxwiki.pdf.
    NOTE: it may happen that trying to optimize signalling traffic the controller aggregates in one TCP segment
    multiple commands directed to a given switch. This may degrade the quality of measurements with hard to control
    delay variations. Little can be done about it without modyfying POX libraries and we rather have to live with this feature.
